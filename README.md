REST (Representational State Transfer) is a type of web architecture and a set of constraints that are typically used for designing web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to POST (create), PUT (update), GET (read), and DELETE (delete) data. RESTful API communication is stateless, meaning that the server does not store any data between requests, 
and client requests can be made to any server that is able to understand the API.
